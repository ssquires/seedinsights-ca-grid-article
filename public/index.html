        <h2>DESIGNING CALIFORNIA'S NEW POWER GRID</h2>
        <h3> Research by Alessandro Zocca; written by Alessandro Zocca, Lee Rosenthal, Noah Olsman, Sam Squires, Donal O'Sullivan, Cat Alvarez, and Irene Farr. </h3>
        <p>California’s commitment to 100% carbon-neutral energy poses
          challenges for its existing infrastructure. Caltech researchers have
          created a tool that can help design a more resilient energy grid.</p>

  <h2>The Renewable Revolution</h2>
  <p>Do you know where your electricity comes from? If you are charging your device while reading this article, you are probably plugged in to the local power grid. The router that connects you to the internet, the lights in your building, and your refrigerator are all powered by the grid. We take this for granted; electricity is always available exactly when we need it.</p>
  <p>Power grids are among the most complex and critical networks in modern-day society. California’s power grid alone is a massive network of generators, transmission lines, and substations that supply over 500,000 megawatts of electricity every day.</p>
  <p>California’s power grid is about to undergo a transformation. In September 2018, governor Jerry Brown signed SB-100 into law, committing the state to a 100% zero-carbon energy supply by 2045. The law requires that at least 60% of California’s new zero-carbon energy will come from renewable sources, such as solar and wind. The rest will come from carbon-neutral sources such as nuclear power and hydroelectric dams, which are not unlimited resources but do not produce greenhouse gases.</p>

    <p class='footnote'>* <a href='https://cleantechrising.com/whats-the-difference-between-carbon-neutral-zero-carbon-and-negative-emissions/'>Carbon-neutral</a> energy production may still involve carbon dioxide emissions, but offsets emissions using carbon-capture technology for a net zero effect.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='end-viz'></div>
  <p>Increasing reliance on renewable sources is crucial for a more sustainable energy system, but their variable and intermittent generation can also threaten the reliability of the grid. The way the state handles the transformation to carbon-free energy will determine whether it will be able to support itself with a consistent, reliable supply of renewable energy or end up with a brittle system prone to failures and blackouts.</p>

  <h2>The Grid Today: Supply and Demand</h2>
  <p>The power grid today is a top-down system that has been designed to distribute energy in a single direction: outward from large power plants to consumers. Combined with utility-controlled energy generation from coal and natural gas, this grid is reliable and can transport electricity at whatever rate is needed on a given day.</p>
  <p>The graph below shows California’s demand for power over time on a typical day in January. This demand, also known as load, changes as the day passes, and peaks in the evening.</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>
  <div id='energy-demand' class='line-chart'>
  </div>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>Solar and wind power already account for nearly 20% of California’s total energy generation. Solar power alone accounts for over a third of California’s renewable energy generation. Because solar power is only available during the day, total renewable production rises quickly in the morning and falls again in the evening.</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>
  <div id='renewable-production' class='line-chart'>
  </div>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>The gap between renewable production and demand for energy, called the net load, is shown in the graph below:</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>
  <div id='duck-curve' class='line-chart'>
  </div>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>This shape is also called the duck curve, and illustrates one of the key challenges faced in renewable energy development. Solar energy provides plenty of energy close to noon. However, in order to keep up with demand, energy sources must supply much more energy during the early morning and evening, and less in-between. We currently rely on conventional power generation, like natural gas and hydropower, to make up for the net load. While these energy sources are not renewable, they are plentiful and quick to respond to demand -- exactly what is needed to compensate for the steep drop in solar power production when the sun sets.</p>
  <p>In principle, investment in wind energy can supplant the coal and natural gas that we have burned for more than a century. In practice, wind has its own obstacles, akin to solar use on partially cloudy days. Regional weather pattern and wind speeds are highly variable on short time scales, making individual wind farms an inconsistent power source. Therefore, the power output from individual wind farms is intermittent, even on days during which a broader region’s total wind farm energy output appears constant.</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>
  <div id='wind-graph' class='line-chart'>
  </div>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>To function properly, a power grid must maintain a balance between supply and demand. As more renewables are added to the grid, this becomes increasingly difficult, and can even put the grid at risk of failure. </p>
  <h2>Renewable Grid: Increased Risk of Blackouts?</h2>
  <p>Solar and wind energy generation possess the same vulnerability: They are highly variable over both time and location, and often unpredictably so. Low points in production, due to clouds or still air, sharply contrast with high points, when there are exceptionally sunny or gusty days. This can lead to sudden, large-scale changes in power supply to a power grid, which makes it difficult to adequately predict how much conventional power might be needed to make up for a dearth of renewable energy. When there is an excess of renewable energy generation, the grid is at risk of experiencing a massive blackout.</p>
  <p>When a transmission line experiences a power surge, it may be damaged or its protection mechanisms may be tripped. Once a line fails, the power that would have flowed through it is automatically redirected through neighboring lines. If any of these lines are overloaded and fail in turn, the problem spreads to a broader network of transmission lines. In this way, the failure of a single transmission line can lead to cascading failures and cause a large-scale blackout.</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>
  <svg id='blackout' class='graph-map' x='0' y='0' width='100%' viewBox='-3.25 -2.75 6 5.25'>
  </svg>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>Due to the fact that reliance on renewables increases the risk of power surges and blackouts, drastic action is sometimes required to keep a renewable grid up and running. For example, during a particularly gusty period in 2007, China had to deliberately idle one third of all of their wind turbines, because the national grid was close to overloading.</p>
  <p>Even today, California often has to throttle back its solar energy production to prevent the state grid from overloading. If the state hopes to increase its dependence on solar and wind power without making this problem worse, it needs to be able to quantify the failure risk of different sectors of the grid, and make design decisions that minimize this risk when expanding its renewable infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Besides the fact that we can’t control when the wind blows or the sun shines, another factor makes it difficult to integrate more renewables into the grid: wind or solar farms that are geographically close together have highly correlated energy outputs.</p>
  <p>For example, a particularly gusty day in Kern Country could fully drive all the turbines at Alta Wind Energy Center, the largest wind farm in the United States. This would cause a sudden burst of power generation that could overload nearby transmission lines.</p>
  <p>Solar farms can experience an equivalent challenge. If multiple solar farms are clustered near each other, their electricity output will generally rise and fall at the same time as the sun rises and sets, or clouds pass by. The solar eclipse of August 2017 resulted in a massive dip in solar energy production, and network operators had to analyze the situation in advance to ensure that there would be no disruptions in the local power supply. </p>
  <p>Clustering too many solar or wind farms can increase the risk of power surges when output spikes, or cause “brownouts” when not enough power is available. As California continues to invest in renewable infrastructure, it needs to do so in a way that minimizes this risk. Fortunately, researchers at Caltech and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in Amsterdam are collaborating to overcome this challenge.</p>

  <h2>Modeling The Power Grid: Design Matters</h2>
  <p>The American and Dutch collaboration has explored how to use statistical methods to predict which power lines in a grid are most likely to fail, given a power surge in a specific location. They model a power grid as a network of nodes, representing places where electricity is produced (e.g. generators) and consumed (e.g. cities), which are connected by transmission lines.</p>

  <p>The model assumes that, at any specific time of the day, the power supplied by each renewable energy source, and the power consumption in each city/district, both fluctuate randomly around a set average value. This results in random fluctuations in the power flowing through the lines connecting the nodes. If the power flowing through a line exceeds its capacity, it may overload and “fail”. </p>
  <p>Using historical data to infer the correlation structure of the fluctuations, the model identifies the lines that are most prone to failure. Understanding which transmission lines are most vulnerable opens the possibility of preventative actions that can avert cascading failures and the resulting blackouts. In the map below, the failure risk of each transmission line is indicated by its color.</p>

  <p>Creating a sustainable, zero-carbon grid requires careful planning to ensure that California’s power flow remains reliable and secure. When a model such as that created by researchers at Caltech and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica is implemented during the early stages of wind and solar farm expansions, these resources can be scaled up far more effectively. This model can assist in optimizing the grid, preventing clustering of renewable resources that can lead to cascading blackouts.</p>
  <p>As California looks to expand its renewable energy production, a seemingly natural strategy could be to enlarge current wind and solar farms, since they have likely purposely been placed in windy and sunny areas where they can be highly effective. However, applying the model to this situation shows that this approach worsens the risk of failure.</p>
  <p>This happens for precisely the reasons discussed in the previous section--if more wind turbines are added to a small geographical area, energy output will increase more steeply when the wind gusts, leading to a greater risk of overload. If the infrastructure connecting these farms to nearby cities is not upgraded accordingly, risk rises even higher.</p>

  <h2>Looking to the Future: Managing Risk for a Reliable Grid</h2>
  <p>Power grid models in isolation are not enough to guarantee reliable clean energy. Several technologies and strategies for successful renewable expansion are being pursued concurrently, and models such as the one in this article can help improve these strategies. Together, they can pave the road to an zero-carbon California.</p>
  <h3>1. Strategic grid design</h3>
  <p>Keeping the grid safe and reliable as renewables scale up requires strategic and well-informed infrastructure decisions. New construction must account for the spatio-temporal correlations in renewable power generation. New energy facilities can be built more heterogeneously throughout California, and long-range transmission lines may allow any currently clustered renewable energy to be distributed across larger areas. Modeling proposed new facilities or transmission lines can help inform their placement.</p>
  <h3>2. Smart grids</h3>
  <p>A smart grid encompasses multiple grid monitoring technologies, from smart meters and transmission line sensors to automated energy distribution systems. On an individual level, smart meters can make us more aware of our own energy consumption habits and allow us to sell power from distributed resources, such as residential solar panels, back to the main grid. Paired with monetary incentives, this direct monitoring may even have the potential to mitigate demand during peak hours. But these distributed resources cannot be safely connected to the main grid without smart grid technologies to detect and prevent power fluctuations. The smart grid’s anonymized data allows energy distributors to react quickly to changes in supply or demand, pinpoint failures, and potentially control individual resources. This greatly increases the flexibility of the grid and reduces the chances of power surges and failures. These grid technologies are already being implemented in places like Hawaii and Germany.</p>
  <h3>3. Distributed energy systems</h3>
  <p>Rebates and tax incentives have greatly increased individual interest in residential renewables. Homeowners have started to change the grid with the adoption of residential solar panels, energy storage, and electric cars. Despite intense interest, battery technology has not kept up with the increasing demand for energy storage and is unlikely to be the main solution to the duck curve and other energy reliability issues. However, large numbers of batteries such as those on electric cars can make a difference if they are able to adapt their charging rates in response to current demand on the grid. In combination with smart grid technology, distributed energy has the ability to restructure the entire energy grid into a more flexible system.</p>
  <h3>4. A national grid</h3>
  <p>There is support among clean energy analysts for a centralized national energy grid. A highly interconnected and centralized grid may improve energy efficiency, increase implementation of renewables, and lower energy rates. Modeling is an important tool for the planning of transmission line expansions that would need to occur, since it can directly evaluate risks or benefits from adding new lines or new renewable generators to the system.</p>
  <p>The world is starting to make a change towards sustainable power grids, with countries such as Germany at the forefront of renewable generation. In 2017, China had the highest renewable power capacity in the world. Costa Rica plans to be carbon-neutral by 2021. These global forces are setting the standards for sustainability, and demonstrating that it is possible to make a grid both renewable and reliable. California has proven that it too can be one of the leaders in the future of clean energy, and by using models to make informed decisions we can ensure a zero-carbon power grid has the same safety and reliability that we’ve always counted on.</p>
  <p>This idea is intimately related with that of a national energy grid. A nation-wide more interconnected and centralized grid is supported by clean energy analysts as it would improve energy efficiency, increase implementation of renewables, and lower energy rates. The challenge is in identifying how exactly transmission lines will be expanded, keeping fluctuating energy supplies and demands in mind, across such a grand scale of states, regions, and other jurisdictions with varying timelines and priorities. In this respect, the model developed in the article can be an important tool for grid expansion planning, since it can be used to evaluate what benefits or risks of adding new lines or new renewable generation. </p>
  <p>Another complementary effort should be made on the demand side. Indeed, the grid would greatly benefit if we could reduce the magnitude of demand peaks and to distribute the energy consumption more evenly across the day (cf. duck curve) or when there is a large renewable energy production.</p>
  <p>In order to do achieve this, a necessary step is a widespread adoption of smart meters. Smart meters enable users to be more aware of (and possibly adapt) their energy consumption and, at the same time, they would allow energy managers (aggregators?utilities?) to anonymously collect data that would allow them react more promptly to demand changes or pinpoint more easily failures, making restoration of power faster and more dependable. This technology is already mature and, in fact, already in 2016, Germany committed $23.6 billion to implement smart metering throughout its grid.</p>
  <p>The capability of smart grids are further supported by the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources, such as residential solar panels (which are now required on new houses in California CITE) electric vehicles, and home batteries. Collectively, distributed energy resources can be connected to the grid and allow energy users to shift some of their demand to energy resources as local as their own backyards. Distributed generation can even allow users to monetize their own energy production by selling excess energy back to the grid.</p>
  <p>The next step would then be implementing on a large scale programs that would encourage residential or business customers to draw on electricity at different hours or even better allow the grid to directly reduce the energy supply to specific households/businesses for short periods of time. In this scenario the network operator could temporarily switch off some electrical appliances (fridges, pool pumps, AC machines, etc.) which energy demand can be deferred in time by some minutes without a major impact on their functionality. In this way, at aggregate level the grid would become more flexible, being able to shave peak demand and respond better to emergency situations or contingencies.</p>
  <p>Electric vehicles could also provide helpful ancillaries services to the grid, if they could adapt their charging rate to the current grid situation, e.g. temporarily pause their charging in the moment of peak demand and charge instead where there is an excess of renewable power in the system. In fact, electric vehicles can be seen as a large distributed population of “moving batteries”, which, with reasonable flexibility on the customer side and appropriate coordination, could help balance out the supply and demand of renewable power without the need of expanding stationary storages, as outlined in this research article https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabe97/meta. This work will pave the way for the future of renewable energy.</p>
